# odin-recipes
Make a simple website consisting of a main index page which will have links to three recipes. 
With this exercise I will learn to:
- Create and clone git repositories
- Create the index page (html boilerplate)
- Use anchor tags to add links and images
- Use ordered and unordered lists
